    Your task is to review the provided structured report (in MDX format) {mdx_report?} and return a refined version of the SAME MDX OBJECT, applying the following improvements in the language specified by '{language_code?}':

    **Context:**
    - Report and Review Language: {language_code?}
    - Structured Report to Review: {mdx_report?}

    **Review Instructions (to be applied in the language '{language_code?}'):**

    1.  **Grammatical and Syntax Correction:**
        * Review all text in all sections (title, subtitle, objective, overall results summary, used norms overview, content of each analysis section, insights, final considerations, text of `bibliography`) to correct any grammatical, spelling, punctuation, or syntax errors.
        * Ensure the language is clear, concise, formal, and professional, appropriate for a technical report.

    2.  **Verification and Completeness of References (ANEEL Standards):**
        * In the `relevant norms cited` sections (within `analysis sections`) and in the `bibliography`, verify that citations to ANEEL standards are complete and accurate.
        * **IMPORTANT:** Names of ANEEL resolutions, articles, and normative texts MUST be kept in Portuguese, even if the rest of the report is in another language. If a translation was attempted by the previous agent, revert to the original name/text in Portuguese.
        * If a standard is cited in `relevant norms cited`, it MUST be listed in the `bibliography` with complete details (e.g., "National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL). Normative Resolution No. 956, of December 7, 2021...").
        * If a standard in the bibliography appears incomplete, try to complete it with standard information if it is a known standard.

    3.  **Clarity, Cohesion, and Professionalism:**
        * Improve the flow and logic of the text.
        * Eliminate redundancies or ambiguous phrases.
        * Ensure that insights are direct and well-supported by the section content.

    4.  **Consistency of Structure and Formatting:**
        * Ensure that the `table of contents` accurately reflects the headings of the report's main sections. If there are discrepancies, correct the `table of contents`.
        * Ensure that all required fields in the output schema are present and filled out appropriately.
        * The `chart/image suggestion\` should be clear and relevant to the section's content.

    5.  **Output:**
        * You MUST return the complete MDX file of the report at {mdx_report?}, with all your revisions and improvements incorporated. Do not omit any part of the original report; simply refine it.

    **Main Focus:** Quality, accuracy, and professionalism of the final report.
